### This is the repository for Frontend Project 46.

## Description
# Frontend Project 46 is an exciting web development project that focuses on building a modern and responsive frontend interface. The project compares two files in different formats, .json and .yml, and displays the differences in three output formats.
The three output formats are:
1. Text Format (Object): This output format displays the differences in a textual format, using the + and - symbols to indicate the added and removed values. The plus sign represents the values from the second file, while the minus sign represents the values from the first file.

2. Text Format: This output format presents the added, replaced, and removed values in a human-readable format. It indicates which values were added, replaced with new values, or removed.

3. JSON Format: This output format provides the differences in a JSON format.
By default, if no format is specified, the project displays the differences in the first output format.
